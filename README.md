# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game that involves a grid of 3x3 cells. Players take turns marking a cell with their designated symbol, either 'X' or 'O,' with the objective of forming a row, column, or diagonal of their symbols before the opponent does. The game is played on a graphical interface created using the Pygame library in Python.

The abstracted structure of the game involves initializing the game window, rendering the grid, and handling player interactions through mouse clicks. The game logic includes checking for a winner or a draw after each move, allowing for a continuous loop of gameplay. The code incorporates features such as drawing the game grid, handling player turns, and determining the game outcome. Players are informed of the result through console messages, and the game resets for a new round.

This abstracted representation provides a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanics of a simple Tic Tac Toe implementation using Pygame, serving as a starting point for further customization and expansion of features.
